👋 Hi, I’m @MarcPhilippeJoly

👀 I’m interested in computer science, mechanics, geometry, analysis, intelligence and passive design.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to not suck at JavaScript, growing vegetables at home, solving other's tech issues and updating my very old works to nowadays techs.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making this world nicer, more fun and comfy.

✨ I need help building the first prototype of a brand new generation of amazing wind-powered vehicles that will change the art of sailing forever.
